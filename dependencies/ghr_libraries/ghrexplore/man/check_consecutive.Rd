}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe containing the dataset. Must include the time variable
and optionally an group variable.}

\item{time}{A string representing the name of the column in \code{data} that contains time values.
The column should be in "yyyy-mm-dd" format.}

\item{group}{(Optional) A string representing the names of the columns in \code{data}
that contain grouping information. If provided, the check will
be performed separately for group.}
}
\value{
A logical value: \code{TRUE} if all time values (within each group if \code{group} is specified)
are consecutive, and \code{FALSE} otherwise.
}
\description{
This function verifies whether time values in a dataset are consecutive,
based on the detected time interval (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).
If a \code{group} column is specified, the check is performed within each group.
