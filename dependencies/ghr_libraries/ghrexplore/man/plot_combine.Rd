\usage{
plot_combine(
  plot_list,
  combine_legend = FALSE,
  combine_xaxis = FALSE,
  ncol = 1,
  align = "v",
  ...,
  ncol_l = 2,
  nrow_l = NULL,
  rel_widths_l = c(3, 1),
  rel_heights_l = c(1, 1),
  ncol_legend = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{plot_list}{requires as input a list of plots}

\item{combine_legend}{logical. If TRUE, assumes the legend of all plots is
the same as the legend of the first plot in plot_list and final plot
shows only one instance of the common legend. Default is FALSE.}

\item{combine_xaxis}{logical. If TRUE, removes x axis labels from all but the
last plot. Default is FALSE.}

\item{ncol}{(from cowplot) number of colums in the plot grid. Default 1.}

\item{align}{(from cowplot) specifies how plots should be aligned
Options are "none", "hv" (align in both directions), "h", and "v" (default).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to cowplot::plotgrid}

\item{ncol_l}{when combine_legend = TRUE
number of colums in which to align plots and the common legend. Default 2}

\item{nrow_l}{when combine_legend = TRUE
number of rows in which to align plots and the common legend. Default NULL.}

\item{rel_widths_l}{when combine_legend = TRUE
vector of widths in which to align plots and the common legend. Default = c(3, 1)}

\item{rel_heights_l}{when combine_legend = TRUE
vector of heights in which to align plots and the common legend. Default = c(1, 1)}

\item{ncol_legend}{when combine_legend = TRUE
number of columns the legend should be distributed in. Default 1 column}
}
\value{
a single plot representing multiple plots
}
\description{
combines plots, each representing one variable, into a single plot
}
\details{
this function takes any input from the cowplot::plot_grid function to
customize the organization of the plots. To customize organization of a common
plot legend to the combined plots, use parameters with the suffix "_l".
}
\examples{
# Load data
data("dengue_MS")

# Multiple time series plot
plots <- plot_multiple(
  plot_function = plot_timeseries,
  data = dengue_MS,
  var = c("tmax", "tmin", "pdsi"),
  type = c("cov", "cov", "cov"),
  aggregate_space = "meso_code",
  pop = "population",
  var_label = c("Max Temp", "Min Temp", "PDSI"),
  time = "date",
  area = "micro_code")

# Combine them with a shared legend
plot_combine(plot_list = plots, 
             ncol = 1,
             align = "v",
             combine_legend = TRUE,
             combine_xaxis = TRUE,
             rel_widths_l = c(7,1))
